Exam Projects

This repo contains Python and R code files from previous exam projects. It will be updated continuously as more projects are finished. 

As of now the repo contains only two project; 

1. My first master semester project in Python Programming and Linear Algebra (DS_FinalProject):

The project contains three seperate applications of related topics such as a pseudo NumPy Class, Hamming's (7,4) linear error-correction code (an encoder, decoder and error corrector program), and a program that by relying on OOP, in addition to a number of additional features, can compute text document similarity between different documents in a given corpus. In addition, there is a minor code file analysing Big Oh notation for the projects most dominating parts in terms of computational complexity. 


2. A Data Science project from my bachelor demonstrating competences within data analysis and predictive analytics with R(B_DS_FinalProject_R):

This projects is also devided in to several seperate sections all code however remains in one file. The initial section consists of basic data work and wrangling. The following section is related to NLP and involves tokenization and a minor sentiment analysis. The last sections of the project demonstrates application of logistic and lasso regression for prediction including calculations of relevant parameters for model evaluation (in- and out-of-sample).
