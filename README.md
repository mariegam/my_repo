Exam Projects

This repo contains Python code files from previous exam projects. It will be updated continuously as more projects are finished. 

As of now the repo contains only a single file; my first semester project in Python Programming and Linear Algrbra. The project contains three seperate applications of related topics such as a pseudo NumPy Class, Hamming's (7,4) linear error-correction code (a encoder, decoder and error correction program), and a program that by relying on OOP, in addition to a number of additional features, can compute the text document similarity between different documents in a given corpus.
