Exam Projects

This repo contains Python code files from previous exam projects. It will be updated continuously as more projects are finished. 

As of now the repo contains only a single project; my first semester project in Python Programming and Linear Algebra (DS_Final_Project). The project contains three seperate applications of related topics such as a pseudo NumPy Class, Hamming's (7,4) linear error-correction code (a encoder, decoder and error correction program), and a program that by relying on OOP, in addition to a number of additional features, can compute text document similarity between different documents in a given corpus. In addition, there is a minor code file analysing Big Oh notation for the projects most dominating parts in terms of computational complexity.
